### **Project Title**: **Modular Embedded OS Kernel with Real-Time Capabilities**  

---

### **Objective**  
Create a lightweight, modular embedded operating system kernel designed for microcontrollers with limited resources (no MMU). This OS will support real-time scheduling, peripheral drivers, and basic inter-process communication (IPC), combining concepts from bare-metal development, RTOS design, and kernel architecture.

### **Key Features**  

1. **Custom Bootloader**  
   - Design a minimal bootloader to initialize hardware, load the kernel, and provide secure firmware update functionality.  

2. **Task Scheduler**  
   - Implement a preemptive priority-based scheduler with real-time task support.  
   - Add support for dynamic task creation and deletion.  

3. **Memory Management**  
   - Build a simple heap allocator and memory segmentation for task isolation, even without an MMU.  

4. **Device Drivers**  
   - Write low-level drivers for UART, I2C, and SPI communication.  
   - Implement a virtual filesystem (e.g., FAT) for accessing external storage.  

5. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**  
   - Develop IPC mechanisms like message queues, semaphores, and event flags for task communication.  

6. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**  
   - Abstract hardware specifics to make the OS portable across different microcontroller families.  

7. **Debugging and Monitoring**  
   - Add kernel debugging features like logging, task tracing, and performance metrics visualization via a connected PC interface.  

8. **Extensibility**  
   - Include support for user-defined modules such as sensor integration or motor control to demonstrate real-world applications.

### **Technologies and Tools**  

- **Programming Languages**:  
  - **C**: For kernel and driver development.  
  - **Assembly**: For bootloader and low-level hardware initialization.  

- **Hardware**:  
  - ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers (e.g., STM32, TI MSP430).  
  - Optional: RISC-V board (e.g., SiFive HiFive).  

- **Debugging and Testing**:  
  - OpenOCD, GDB, and a JTAG/SWD debugger.  
  - QEMU for initial kernel testing and emulation.  

- **Development Environment**:  
  - GCC ARM toolchain or Clang for cross-compilation.  
  - Makefile or CMake for build automation.  

- **Communication Protocols**:  
  - UART for console output and debugging.  
  - I2C/SPI for peripheral communication.  

- **Optional**:  
  - **Python**: For writing a PC-side monitoring tool to visualize kernel logs and task activity.  
  - **Docker**: For containerizing the build environment to ensure reproducibility.

### **Project Scope and Challenges**  
1. **Integration**: Combine the functionality of bare-metal drivers, RTOS schedulers, and kernel IPC.  
2. **Efficiency**: Optimize the kernel for low memory usage (target <16 KB).  
3. **Debugging**: Handle issues like stack overflows and synchronization bugs in real-time environments.  
4. **Portability**: Abstract hardware-specific code to enable use across multiple microcontroller platforms.
